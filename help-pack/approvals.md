## Common questions

**How do I approve multiple items?**  
Select the items with the checkboxes, then use **Approve selected** or **Reject selected** from the toolbar.

**Where are my approved items?**  
Go to **Approvals** → **History** and use the date and type filters.

**I don’t see a request.**  
Confirm you’re on **Approvals** → **Pending** and that filters (date, type) aren’t hiding it. Ask your admin if you should have access.
